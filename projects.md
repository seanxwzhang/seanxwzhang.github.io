Here I showcase some of the engineering projects I've led or participated starting from January 2016.


## DingDing Parking OA System
*capstone project in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supported by the University and [DingDing Parking](http://www.dingdingtingche.com/)*

The goal of this project is to address the problem of better utilizing existent human resources in the progress of building an internet-based parking system.

This project has won the silver award of [UM-SJTU Design Expo 2016](http://umji.sjtu.edu.cn/news/2016-ji-summer-design-expo-hot-on-internet-of-things/).

Technology-wise, this project consists of smartwatches running on ticwear OS and a web server. I was responsible for building the web server: designing RESTful API, build the frontend with AngularJS. The server runs on Node.JS and Express.


## Operating System Projects

*course project for EECS482 Operating System in University of Michigan. It comprised of four different projects, all written in C++*

_Project 1:_ Writing multithread programs with pthreads.

_Project 2:_ Implement mutex system for multithread systems.

_Project 3:_ Write an external pager system.

_Project 4:_ Implement a unix-like file system.

## Face Swap

*course project for EECS442 Computer Vision in University of Michigan*

The project aims at devising an algorithm for face swapping and an implementation that follows. See details [here]({{site.baseurl}}/public/pdf/face-swap-realization.pdf)


## Advanced Navigation System for People with Low Vision

*capstone project in University of Michigan, supported by University of Michigan and [Dr. Ojeda](http://lojeda.engin.umich.edu/)*

This project aims to increase the information throughput for people with low vision in a navigational scenario. It consists of a depth camera and a haptic wristband. I was responsible for image processing, path detection, and wristband design. The depth camera captures the depth information, which is then processed with the technique proposed in [J Borenstein, Y Koren's paper](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~johannb/Papers/paper16.pdf) implemented with openCV in C++.
