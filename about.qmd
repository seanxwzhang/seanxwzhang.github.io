## About me
Thanks for visiting my space, this where I learn, think, and write. 

My background is mostly in **distributed machine learning systems**. 

* I graduated from University of Michigan (*summa cum laude*) and Shanghai Jiao Tong University with degrees in both Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Computer Engineering.
* I obtained my Master's degree from UCLA in Computer Science (specialization: data mining and machine learning).
* I spent 2 years in Meta's marketplace team working on recommendation systems.
* I spent 2 years in Voleon (largest quant HF in California) working on data and systems.
* I spent 3 years traveling and exploring, learning about the mathematical foundation behind deep learning, implemented various models and architectures, played a lot with GPU kernels.

I currently work at [Manifest AI](https://manifestai.com/), carrying out research on efficient language modeling.

I also believe in [Longtermism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longtermism) where positively influencing the long-term future is the priority of our time. 

I'm currently based in Vancouver, Canada. I can be reached at sz@seanzhang.me.
