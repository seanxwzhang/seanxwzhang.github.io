				<h3>Vibration Assisted Nanopositioning Stage</h3>

				<b>Nanopositioning stage</b> is essential to high-precision engineering applications such as wafer scanner, Super-resolution (SR) Microscopy, Optical Tweezers, and Optical Traps. However, the nonlinear behavior of contact friction results in either a high cost of non-contact motion technology or an undesireble long setttling time.<br>
				In this project, together with Xin Dong and Lin Bo, we developed a nano-positioning stage using traditional roller bearings with piezo electric actuator to bring down the setttling time significantly.<br>

					<h3> Application of Atomic Force Microscopy on Multimedia Medium </h3>
					<div class="w3-row">
						<div class="w3-col m8 w3-container">
							<p class="w3-left-align">
							The atomic force microscope (AFM) is one kind of scanning probe microscopes (SPM). SPMs are designed to measure local properties, such as height, friction, magnetism, with a probe. To acquire an image, the SPM raster-scans the probe over a small area of the sample, measuring the local property simultaneously. <br>
							AFMs operate by measuring force between a probe and the sample by exciting the probe via piezo electric actuator at a certain frequency and sensing its amplitude. The corresponding topology information of the surface is acquired by the reflection of the laser beam as shown on the right. <br>
							In this project, we used AFM to obtain the topology of three kinds of disks and reconstruct 3D images of that information. Analysis of the modulation methods of different multimedia mediums is then carried out to determine the opto-mechanical design requirements for multimedia players. <br><br>

However, the nonlinear behavior of contact friction results in either a high cost of non-contact motion technology or an undesireble long setttling time.<br>

								After building a working prototype, I identified the GMS model parameters by analyzing the frequency responses of the system and pinpointing the individual peaks.

								To provide a better friction compensator than one based on GMS, I modified Professor Nilkhamhang’s research on adaptive friction compensators using LuGre model and added Particle Swarm Optimization to make the model results converge faster and with better friction prediction.

					<h3> A Controllable Adaptive Module </h3>

						<div class="w3-col m8 w3-container">
						<p class="w3-left-align">
						Passive-adaptable mechanical properties enabled via multi- and metastable architectures provide valuable versatility for many engineering applications. Such features include stiffness and damping tunability, or dramatic shape change. However, few efforts have explored the potential for embedded actuation of such architectures. This project develops a compact, controlled, multistable module that actively switches between metastable states for intelligent properties adaptation. <br>
						The key idea in this project is to propose a structure that is both metastable and controllable, where metastable refers to the mechanical property of a strcutre that is able to have the same stiffness under different global deflection and the same deflection with different stiffness. Also, the structure itself should be modular so that it is able to be connected to other modules to have required adaptive mechanical properties with different configuration. <br>

								The structure I proposed consists of two bending plate and a series of connecting parts to transfer its torque. In the middle there is a coil spring to generate the variation of stiffness. <br>

						This project aimed at connnecting Nintendo Controller with an Altera Cyclone FPGA Board and being able to read a certain combination of inputs from the controller to responde correspondingly. <br>
						To transfer data from the Nintendo Controller to the FPGA board, a series of Latch and Pulse signals were generated at a proper clock frequency， after which the controller status is transmitted to the FPGA board in real time. An "Easter Egg" is preset so that when a certain series of input is read, all the LEDs on the FPGA borad will flash.<br>
						The Cyclone IV FPGA board was also used, with Quartus, to build counters and simulator of traffic lights. <br>

						During the project, we built controllers with Simulink program and used Arduino as the interface between controllers and the hardware. We practiced PID controller, lead/lag control design, designs via state space and frequence response, and so on. <br>

						While studying fundamentals of mechanical engineering, it can be difficult to visualize what we are learning about. Therefore, it is helpful to have hands-on access to concepts and ideas we might work with in the future. To gain practical experience working with four-bar linkages, motors and their accessories, and mechatronics, as well as a model-based design process, we were given a project to design, build, and test a device with all three of these components. We tried to emulate the design, manufacturing, and testing processes as close as possible to a process in how to solve a real-life engineering problem.

						A common problem which demands urgent solution for students in SJTU who ride bikes to class is that they lost their keys for bike locks often and the process of unlocking the bike with ordinary locks is annoying. We came up with a solution using capacitive touch panel to build a touch lock which doesn't entail a key at all. <br>
						The touch system uses 9 capacitive touch sensor for password input as well as one button for reset. The input password is then compared with the one in the Arduino memory which is constantly updated via GSM module, a communication module between singlechips and termnials like cellphones. <br>
						The touch system is able to alert the user if the number of wrong inputs reaches a certain value by sending messages to the user. <br>
						We also encapsulated the hardware (except for the touch panel under the seat) in a water-proof case to keep the system from rain.
