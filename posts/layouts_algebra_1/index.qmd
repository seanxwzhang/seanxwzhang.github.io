When writing code that involves multi-dimensional arrays, it's common to encouter the concept of "layout". For example

# Layouts

The 


```{python}
import cutlass
import cutlass.cute as cute

layout = cute.make_layout((2, (1, 6)), stride=(1, (cutlass.Int32(6), 2)))
print(layout)
print(cute.coalesce(layout))
```
